  "Greetings / E kene m unu!",
  "After about 3 years of rigorous discussions aimed at shaping the Wikimedia 2030 strategy, the Wikimedia community has come up with ten (10) solid recommendations that would guide our actions from now on in this movement",
  "One very important recommendation in the line-up is to ‚ÄúProvide for Safety and Inclusion‚Äù and a major action point in this recommendation is to create a universal code of conduct, which would be designed and implemented in conjunction with our communities across the globe.",
  "The universal code of conduct would be a movement-wide policy which seeks to ensure the existence of a universal baseline of acceptable behaviour for everyone participating in our movement, in order to minimize incidents of harassment, bullying, discrimination or even disenfranchisement",
  "This is even more important for much smaller Wikipedia languages like the Igbo Wikipedia, where policies like this do not already exist",
  "A first draft of the Universal Code of Conduct was concluded in October 2020.",
  "As a global movement, we aim to further develop and enforce this very important blueprint through an inclusive process, with respect to local contexts and existing structures",
  "Hence, we would like to invite the Igbo Wikipedia community to discuss the different ways that you think that the Universal Code of Conduct should be implemented on this Wikipedia and across the global movement",
  "You can share your initial thoughts directly under this message, or on the UCoC meta talk page",
  "You can also reach out to me personally on my talkpage or privately through my e-mail (soyeyele-ctr@wikimedia.org)",
