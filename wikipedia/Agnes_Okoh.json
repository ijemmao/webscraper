  "Her ministry flourished, but in 1965 she prophesied that Nigeria would soon be in turmoil, and during the Civil War (1966–1970) in eastern Nigeria, closed all the prayer houses and encouraged her converts to move to the more peaceful area of Arondizuogu",
  "The war ended in 1970, things returned to normal, and the Christ Holy Church International, as it was now known, continued to expand.",
  "Throughout her life, Okoh was known for her humility and acts of charity",
  "She has had her enemies and critics and survived an attempt on her life",
  "Some people resented her success as a female evangelist",
  "She retired from the ministry in 1980 and returned to live in her birth town of Ndoni",
  "Here she oversaw the building of a primary school and a nursery school, a maternity unit and a public water supply, and she organised the construction of new roads",
  "She died in 1995 at the age of ninety",
  "Her son predeceased her, but her grandson, Daniel Okoh, is the current overseer of the Christ Holy Church International, which currently employs fifteen hundred pastors, and has nearly two million members."
